# Household-Energy-Consumption
1## Introduction
A regional home developer is looking to develop analytics for a new set of electrical sub-metering devices used for power management in smart homes. Installing these sub-meters could be a big step towards the developer's goal of offering highly efficient smart homes that provide owners with power usage analytics.

We're provided with a very large data set that contains 47 months of energy usage data from these devices. Our goal is to analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can be created that would empower smart home owners with greater understanding and control of their power usage.

In this project, we will begin by exploring some visualizations of the data and then build predictive models that will demonstrate to our client how the data can be used to help a home owner to make decisions about altering power consumption.
